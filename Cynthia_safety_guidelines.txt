Fire training and safeguarding policies.
Key points to remember incase of fire.

Move Calmly: incase of fire, ensure to move calmly to avoid chaos which might lead ti further harm to yourself and other.
Emergency Exits: incase of fires, ensure to use the emergency exits and not the elevators. This is because the elevators might not function in such times as these.
Lock door behind you: After ensuring that you are the last person to leave a room, ensure to lock the door behind you as this might suffocate the fire and extinguish it eventually.
All fours: oxygen is dense and usually settles incase of a fire. Get on your arms and legs to utilize the available oxygen as you proceed out of the room or building.
Fire assembly points: once outside, proceed to the designated fire assembly point as a roll call will be taken to ensure everyone's safety.
